<h3>POSC 295: Research Methods in Political Science</h3>

<p>I taught a tutorial on political science research methods for the (<a href="https://www.oxfordprogram.com/">Oxford Programme for Undergraduate Studies </a>) Spring 2020 class. As the sole instructor, I adapted the syllabus from the course equivalent from the students' home institution, led the tutorial and lab sessions, and evaluated all student works.</p>

<p>POSC 295 is designed to provide students with the substantive knowledge and skills required to evaluate others research, and to conduct their own research, in political science with an emphasis on cross-national research. Key areas of emphasis include: thinking about, and studying, political phenomena scientifically, the development of hypotheses, conceptual and operational definitions of concepts, research design, reliability and validity, sampling, data collection, and statistical analysis.</p>
