<h3>Foreign Policy Decision-Making in International Relations</h3>
			
<p>In Spring 2022, I taught "Foreign Policy Decision-Making in International Relations" at Stanford University. It is a required core course for the Master's in International Policy program. </p>

<p> Course Description: Foreign Policy Decision-Making in International Relations examines the factors that shape how actors develop and implement foreign policy in a comparative context. How do bureaucratic politics and interagency processes across different country contexts facilitate and constrain leaders' decisions? This course draws on scholarship from political science, psychology, history, sociology, and economics to analyze how choices made by individuals, small groups, or coalitions representing nation-states result in policies or strategies with international outcomes. Students will learn how to leverage various social science theories and methodologies to explore and assess how leaders across the world weigh different policy options when responding to international problems.  </p>

<div class="content">
<p>I taught a tutorial on political science research methods for the <a href="https://www.oxfordprogram.com/">Oxford Programme for Undergraduate Studies</a> (Spring 2020). As the sole instructor, I tailored the syllabus to meet the requirements of the course equivalent at the students' home institution, led the tutorial and lab sessions, and evaluated all student works.</p>

<p>POSC 295 is designed to provide students with the substantive knowledge and skills required to conduct their own research in political science. Key areas of emphasis include: concepts and operationalization, research design, reliability and validity of measures, sampling, data collection, and statistical analysis.</p>

<p>The course covered the political implications of emerging technologies in China, with a focus on AI governance. Structured in the format of the Oxford tutorial system , the course investigated the similarities between China's approach to AI governance and its regulation of other dual-use technologies, such as biotechnology. </p>
