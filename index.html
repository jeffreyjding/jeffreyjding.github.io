			<p>Greetings! I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Political Science at George Washington University. Currently, I am also a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's <a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/">Center for International Security and Cooperation</a>, sponsored by Stanford's <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a>. </p>

			<p>My research agenda centers on technological change and international politics. My dissertation investigates how past technological revolutions influenced the rise and fall of great powers, with implications for U.S.-China competition in emerging technologies like AI. Other research projects tackle how states should identify strategic technologies, assessments of national scientific and technological capabilities, and interstate cooperation on nuclear safety and security technologies. My work has been published in <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, <i>Security Studies</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, and other outlets.</p>

            <p>I received my PhD in 2021 from the University of Oxford, where I studied as a Rhodes Scholar. Previously, I worked as a researcher for Georgetown's <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/">Center for Security and Emerging Technology</a> and Oxford's <a href="https://governance.ai/">Centre for the Governance of AI</a> at the University of Oxford. Growing up in Iowa City, I became a lifelong Hawkeye fan and attended the University of Iowa for my undergraduate studies. </p>
