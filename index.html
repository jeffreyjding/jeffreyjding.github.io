			<p>I am a PhD Candidate in international relations at the University of Oxford. For the 2020-2021 academic year, I will be a pre-doctoral at Stanford's <a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/">Center for International Security and Cooperation</a>, sponsored by Stanford's <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a>. I am also a research affiliate with the <a href="https://governance.ai/">Centre for the Governance of AI</a> at the University of Oxford.</p>

			<p>My current research is centered on how technological change affects the rise and fall of great powers. Through investigating historical cases of industrial revolutions, I trace causal mechanisms that connect significant technical breakthroughs and economic power transitions -- with an eye toward the implications of advances in AI for a possible U.S.-China power transition. My previous research covered related topics, including China's development of AI, identifying strategic goods and technologies, and technical standards as a vehicle of AI governance.</p>

            <p>I have a M.Phil in International Relations (2016) from the University of Oxford. In 2019-2020, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in MITâ€™s <a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/">Political Science Department</a> and a fellow at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> at Harvard University.</p>
