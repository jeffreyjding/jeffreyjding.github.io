			<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's <a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/">Center for International Security and Cooperation</a>, sponsored by Stanford's <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a>. I am also a research affiliate with the <a href="https://governance.ai/">Centre for the Governance of AI</a> at the University of Oxford.</p>

			<p>My current research is centered on how technological change affects the rise and fall of great powers. Through investigating historical cases of industrial revolutions, I trace causal mechanisms that connect significant technical breakthroughs and economic power transitions -- with an eye toward the implications of advances in AI for a possible U.S.-China power transition. My previous research covered related topics, including China's development of AI, identifying strategic goods and technologies, and technical standards as a vehicle of AI governance.</p>

            <p>I received my PhD in 2021 from the University of Oxford, where I studied as a Rhodes Scholar. I'm a lifelong Hawkeye who grew up in Iowa City and attended the University of Iowa for my undergraduate studies.</p>
