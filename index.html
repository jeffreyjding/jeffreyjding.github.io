			<p>Greetings! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at George Washington University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's <a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/">Center for International Security and Cooperation</a>, sponsored by Stanford's <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a>. </p>

			<p>I research great power competition and cooperation in emerging technologies, the political economy of innovation, and China's scientific and technological capabilities. My book, _Technology and the Rise of Great Powers_(Princeton University Press, 2024), investigates how past technological revolutions influenced the rise and fall of great powers, with implications for U.S.-China competition in emerging technologies like AI. Other work has been published or is forthcoming in _European Journal of International Security_, _Foreign Affairs_, _International Studies Quarterly_, _Review of International Political Economy_, and _Security Studies_, and my research has been cited in _The Washington Post_, _The Financial Times_, and other outlets.</p>

            <p>I received my PhD in 2021 from the University of Oxford, where I studied as a Rhodes Scholar. Previously, I worked as a researcher for Georgetown's <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/">Center for Security and Emerging Technology</a> and Oxford's <a href="https://governance.ai/">Centre for the Governance of AI</a>. Growing up in Iowa City, I became a lifelong Hawkeye fan and attended the University of Iowa for my undergraduate studies. </p>
